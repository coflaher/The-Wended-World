# Pitch

The world and the magic in it are old, though the nations and conflicts that currently face it feel new. Fairytale magic, dark deals, magic items, the works. The below is just fleshed out enough to give you a feel and sparse enough we can fill in the blanks together later.

## **Technology**

The world is just shy of WW1, with a mix of magic and technology to keep things flexible. Firearms are widely available in the more advanced countries and while the wilds are still magical and dangerous, this world is explored - just full of old magic - timeline wise this seems more 1600s than 1900s but tech wise we are approaching the early 20th century with a lot of magic.

## **Major Nations and Factions**

### **Dennengard (Technology, Organized Religion, Education, Kingdom)**

![Untitled](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/2687288f-a9fc-4af3-bca2-58d689c94059/Untitled.png)

In the history of the world, the nation of Dennegard is actually fairly young, but the people who inhabit it are as old as any across the continent. They are multicultural mostly due to age, and have some of the most advanced technology in the world. Home of trains, guns, and steam. Their capital is Novakrost, a pearl of a city with a magical college on the greatest lake in the world.

-   The Royal Navy
-   The Hounds: Psionic Special Forces
-   Verdan: Goblins touched by the feywild causing wild mutations
-   The Vistani: A group of Romani-esque cultures that have been absorbed by Dennengard
-   The Crown's Army
-   Trent Ostromir's Military Academy
-   The University of Novakrost: Mage School

### **The Vestov Commonwealth (Socialist Revolution, Agrarian, Guerilla Warfare)**

A socialist state formed out of Dennengard defectors 5 years ago. The two are at peace for the time being. They are hardy underdogs for sure.

-   The Kolya Company: A group of happy go lucky mercenaries who worship a god of favors. Sometimes called the Blood Company.

A proud member of the Kolya Copany.

### **The Estarian Empire (Military, Glory, Religious Fervor, Ancient Arts)**

After uniting multiple warring kingdoms under his fist, a young and aggressive royal crowned himself Imperial Avar and Radiant King of Estara. The armies of the Estarian Empire are well funded, and zealous in their belief in their Emperor, who claims, like most Emperors, to have a direct line to divinity.

-   The Black Hand: An elite special forces group within the Estarian military

![Also called the Sublime Estarian Empire.](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/5a71b8bc-a8bc-4540-8559-1377be4e4e10/Untitled.png)

Also called the Sublime Estarian Empire.

### **The Belavor Noble Corporation (Knights Templar, Chivalry, Commerce)**

Less a country more a loose alliance of city states led by a rather forceful version of the Knights Templar.

-   Order of the Gauntlet: A Knight's Templar or Knights of the Round Table equivalent. Worship Helm.

### The Ostfeld (Agrarian, Old Glory, Folk Magic)

Between the Sunian Empire, the Belavor Noble Corporation, and Dennengard sits a a large swathe of farmable land. Once home to ancient kings and orders, now mostly a humble agricultural area, the people of Ostfeld are technically loyal to Dennengard. That said there's a lot of independent spirit and folklore here.

![OpenField.jpg](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/8958962d-bc01-443f-a2a2-cc4f91808ea3/OpenField.jpg)

### **The Sunnian Empire (Aging Empire, Cultural Riches, Mages, Libraries)**

![Untitled](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/c34e4585-77c5-4528-9a02-ebd62191f7b4/Untitled.png)

A decadent place, whose size and age keeps the more aggressive younger nations in check. They are the heart of culture, fashion, and knowledge, and have the largest libraries in the world. Despite this their power and influence is slowly and steadily declining. Have long kept the peace with Dennengard.

### **The Eastern Coast (Lveria, Sharan, Rylk, Muria, Valia, Kimara - Ceremony, Family, Community, Ancient Traditions, Rich Art)**

These are culturally similar to both Estara and Sunnia, perhaps with more of an eastern bent. Emperors, ceremony, respect for dynasty and ancestors permeate here alongside unique foods and martial practices.

### **The Southern Coastal (Axos, Depios, Athosia, Yuria, Valessia - Trade, Mediterranean, Riches, Navy)**

![Untitled](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/213bb363-b7cb-467a-8106-08340d9a16ea/Untitled.png)

Modeled more after the Mediterranean, these small countries specialize in trade and export, have the occasional cult to an evil vile god, divine intervention, and piracy. Their technology is lesser than that of the area around Dennengard but the southern coast has been called "Paradise on Earth", and not without reason.

City states, kings, and mercantile networks have sway here.

-   **The Merchant Princes**: an aristocratic network of merchants so wealthy they can style themselves as nobility.
-   Pirates

### **Old North (Rechinia, Kolyvania, Rosterria, Nedia, Osvirta - Old Magic, Scary Forests, Wilds Untamed)**

![Untitled](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/907f04c0-dde2-4077-9e95-80af7593f595/Untitled.png)

These nations share a culture with Dennengard, but the deep north has not quite been claimed by civilization. The magics run deeper, the feywild is closer, and the people are hardier because of it.

## Lore

### **Gods in use:**

![Untitled](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/77cdf4ee-92aa-41e2-94cf-ec8e539641f7/Untitled.png)

Here's a sampling, but there can be other options. Talk to me about unique deities you might want to incorporate but try to keep it to published settings that have materials I can reference. Stay away from literal real world gods (Thor, Poseidon). The names below are TBD at my whim though (sorry). Still sorting stuff out.

-   Mother Night
-   The Blessed One (Yondalla)
-   The Four Faces of War (Votec) - Only the West
-   The Lord of Bones (Veros) - This god used to be widely worshipped but has fallen out of favor
-   The Morning Lord (Lathandar) - Primary deity of Dennengard
-   The Philosopher - Mostly the East
-   The Radiant King (King of Estara) - Only Estara
-   The Raven Queen
-   The Stormlord (Kord)
-   The Watcher (Helm)
-   The White Mother
-   The Wild Mother (Melora) - Mostly the Coast
-   The Masked Lord
-   The Dark Maiden (Eilestraee)

### Common Creatures:

![Untitled](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/82569dec-cfbf-4416-9a1a-e7b2529bb818/Untitled.png)

-   Fey and Feywild Hags and giant nature spirits called Leshi
-   Heroes of old stories so famous they are practically minor dieties - Exarchs
-   The Plague: A physical manifestation of plague rumored to wander the wilds
-   Dragons and Wyrms

### History Notes

-   Estara is young and feisty and expanding rapidly. They have started skirmishing with Dennengard.
-   The Midnight War: The name for the war that resulted in the separation of the Vestov state from Denendard some ten years ago. The result of this war was the Pact of 1703. Nations who supported this pact are still sometimes referred to as Pact Nations.

## Notes for Character Creation

-   All races and class combos allowed including Tasha's Cauldron of Everything (caveat - _with some review_ as I haven't had a chance to go through everything in detail and some things will need recalibrating. For those concerned, the main issues are with the clerics and some consternation about Cantrip swapping making classes for whom that was previously a perk feel a little underwhelmed.)
-   Custom backgrounds allowed and encouraged, will likely speak with you about your custom background.
-   Notes:
    -   Verdan are allowed but have custom lore attached: their mutations are caused by proximity to the feywild. All other stats and culture notes from the wiki remain the same.
    -   Drow are allowed with some slight modifications to their lore - speak with me if you have an interest in playing one as I would prefer player input here.
    -   Warforged are also allowed but include their creator and origin in your backstory.
-   You may take a free starting feat - unless you use Tasha's to take a feat. Variant humans may take Prodigy and 1 other feat.
-   Roll 4d6, drop the lowest, reroll if the resulting total is below 72. Point Buy and standard array allowed. Please record and send me your rolls before applying modifiers.
-   You may request 1 common magical item. DM discretion.
-   Backstory can be anything, but your character should have a concrete goal and one NPC.
